//	1. Method Overriding - Dynamic Polymorphism - Run Time Polymorphism

	/*
	 * 1. Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an
	 * overridden method is to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. 
	 * 2. It is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch. 
	 * 3. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.
